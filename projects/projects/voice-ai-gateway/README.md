# Voice AI Gateway

An AI-powered voice processing gateway that transforms audio input into structured actions.

## What it does
- Receives voice input (audio file or stream)
- Transcribes speech to text (ASR)
- Detects user intent
- Generates a contextual response
- Returns a voice or text output

## Why this project
This project demonstrates how modern AI can be applied to real-time voice operations such as IVRs, call centers, and automated assistants.

## High-level flow
Voice Input → ASR → Intent Detection → Decision Logic → Response (Text / Voice)

## Use cases
- Intelligent IVR systems
- Call routing based on intent
- Voice-driven automation
- AI assistants for operations

## Status
🚧 In progress — architecture and core flow definition.
