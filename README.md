# LABP-Stack  
### VoIP · AI · Automation · Cloud (AWS-Oriented)

LABP-Stack is a production-focused technical platform for building **intelligent communication systems**, where **voice is the primary interface**, **AI provides decision-making**, **automation executes actions**, and **cloud infrastructure ensures scalability and availability**.

This stack is not a collection of isolated demos.  
It is a coherent ecosystem designed to modernize real-world telephony, contact centers, and communication workflows.

---

## 🎯 Core Focus

- VoIP & Real-Time Communications  
- AI-based Intent Detection  
- Automation & Orchestration  
- Cloud-Native Infrastructure (AWS-Oriented)

---

## 🧠 Stack Philosophy

Modern communication platforms must go beyond traditional PBXs and static IVRs.  
LABP-Stack is built around the following principles:

- Voice-first user interaction  
- AI as a decision layer, not a black box  
- Automation as an operational standard  
- Cloud-first and always-on services  
- Architectures designed for production, not experiments

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

<img width="455" height="418" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/821a055d-fd16-4905-b78a-f808c990f73f" />


This architecture allows the same intelligence layer to be reused across IVR systems, voice agents, omnichannel routing and automated operational workflows.

## 🚀 Current Projects in the Stack

### 1. Intent Detection API — **LIVE (Production)**

**Category:** AI · Backend · Cloud  
**Status:** Deployed and publicly accessible

A production-ready REST API that analyzes user input and classifies intent in real time.  
The service is cloud-hosted and actively consumed by the LABP-Stack frontend demo.

**Key capabilities:**

- Node.js + Express backend  
- Public HTTPS endpoint  
- Intent classification logic designed for extensibility  
- JSON responses for automation pipelines  
- Continuous deployment via Git → Railway  
- CORS-enabled cross-platform consumption  

**Live Demo:**  
Frontend (GitHub Pages) → Backend (Railway) → Real-time response.

### 2. AI Voice Gateway — **Design & Proof of Concept**

**Category:** VoIP · Real-Time Communications · Architecture  
**Status:** Design & PoC

An architectural gateway designed to bridge **voice channels** with **AI-driven intent analysis** and **backend decision logic**.

**Designed use cases:**

- Intelligent IVR systems  
- Voice-based virtual agents  
- Automated call routing  
- Integration with CRMs / ERPs  
- AI-driven outbound call automation

This project represents the **voice entry layer** of the stack.

### 3. RAG Knowledge Assistant — **Work in Progress**

**Category:** AI · Knowledge Systems · Automation  
**Status:** In development

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation assistant designed to provide grounded answers based on structured knowledge sources instead of generic LLM responses.

**Conceptual scope:**

- Query understanding via Intent Detection API  
- Context retrieval from knowledge bases  
- Grounded response generation  
- Integration into voice or chat channels

This project extends the stack from **decision-making** into **knowledge-driven automation**.

---

## ⚙️ Automation & Orchestration Layer

Automation is treated as a first-class component.

Intent classification is used to:

- Trigger workflows  
- Route interactions  
- Escalate cases  
- Integrate external systems  
- Reduce manual operational effort

This enables **self-operating communication platforms**.

---

## ☁️ Cloud & Deployment

- Cloud-hosted backend services  
- Public API endpoints  
- Continuous deployment pipelines  
- Stateless, service-oriented architecture  
- AWS-oriented design principles  
- High-availability mindset

---

## 🔐 VoIP & Security Focus

LABP-Stack is designed with real telephony constraints in mind:

- SIP/RTP optimization  
- NAT traversal & media anchoring  
- TLS / SRTP encryption  
- SBC integration  
- Fraud & SIP attack mitigation  
- GEO-fencing strategies

---

## 📊 Operational Principles

- Always-on services  
- Low-latency API responses  
- Observability-ready design  
- Automation-driven operations  
- Infrastructure as Code mindset

---

## 🧩 Professional Services Alignment

LABP-Stack directly supports real-world consulting and implementation services:

- VoIP migration to AWS
