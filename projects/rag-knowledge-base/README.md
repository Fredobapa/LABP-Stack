# RAG Knowledge Base

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide accurate, source-backed answers from structured documents.

## What it does
- Ingests technical documentation
- Indexes content for semantic search
- Retrieves relevant context based on user queries
- Generates grounded answers using retrieved sources

## Why this project
This project demonstrates how AI systems can reliably answer domain-specific questions without hallucination, making them suitable for production use.

## High-level flow
Documents → Embeddings → Vector Store → Retrieval → Answer Generation

## Use cases
- Voice assistants with factual grounding
- Technical support bots
- Internal knowledge systems
- Documentation search engines

## Status
🚧 In progress — ingestion and retrieval design phase.
